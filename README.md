## Learning C
This repo is a fork of the famous [h0mbre/Learning-C](https://github.com/h0mbre/Learning-C) project which contains exercises to get familiar with the C language.

It contains my own solutions and notes for this material. Also some extra assignments to dive deeper into concepts which I find interesting.

Extra:
- Pointers (including function pointers).
- Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Stack and frames
- Heap
